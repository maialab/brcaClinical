## Licensing

I am using the same licensing pattern as I have seen discussed here for R data packages: https://thinkr-open.github.io/licensing-r/rlicense.html; namely, the example provided in the CRAN accepted package igraphdata: https://github.com/igraph/igraphdata.

In the igraphdata package, Gábor Csárdi (author) has the License field as mine, and the LICENSE file containing the licenses for the individual data sets. So I thought it would be the right approach.

In reality the only other license besides CC BY-SA 4.0, is the ODC Open Database License (ODbL), which is an open source license too. All the remaining text in the LICENSE are details about citations.
